1. Changing the initial accumulator when detecting the cartridge (meh)

2. Other DMA transfer to VRAM instead of OAM

3. Switcheable VRAM banks

4. Switcheable RAM banks (NORMALLY DONE, need to fix for cgb mode only)

5. 2 CRAM (BG and OBJ) with a bunch of registers for it

6. Double speed (meh)

<2-3-4-5 are by far the most important>
