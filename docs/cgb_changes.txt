2. Other DMA transfer to VRAM instead of OAM
    (
        detect cgb functions and propagate it to the rest of the system
        add the vram dma transfer
        add it to the cpu to be able to stop execution of the cpu and simply burn cycles (simply _halted = true)
        implement its two modes with one that is impacted by the mode of the ppu (h-blank)
        the mode basically changes when transfers are initiated
    ) doesnt seem to work, to see if this is true (doesnt on crystal)

3. Switcheable VRAM banks (NORMALLY DONE, need to fix for cgb mode only)
4. Switcheable RAM banks (NORMALLY DONE, need to fix for cgb mode only)

5. 2 CRAM (BG and OBJ) with a bunch of registers for it
   Need to finish #2 in order to properly do this 
    change pixel_transfer to work with the CRAM and the extra banks (theres a bunch of todos already)
doesnt use cram pallets for now, but flipping seems to work

Tetrix DX doesnt even render (doesnt use any dma, is in cgb mode)

<2-3-4-5 are by far the most important>

6. Double speed (meh)
